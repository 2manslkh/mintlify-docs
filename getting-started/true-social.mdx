## True Social

JPEG redefines social media by applying **prediction-market mechanics** to photo sharing. Each photo is a mini-market where users invest in what they find meaningful, funny, or culturally relevant—backing their taste with economic action, not just likes.

### What Is True Social?

Unlike traditional social media, where algorithms dictate trends based on likes and shares, JPEG uses a **market-driven system**. When you collect a photo, you’re making a prediction:

> “This photo deserves attention.”

Your investment, alongside others’, shapes what trends. The community’s collective decisions—not code—determine the winners.

<Tip>
  In JPEG, every collect is a vote of confidence, powered by pixels (PX) and backed by strategy.

### Why It Matters

True Social bridges **cultural attention** and **economic value** in a transparent framework:

- **Active Participation**: Move beyond passive scrolling to actively curate and create.
- **Community-Driven Trends**: Markets replace algorithms, letting user consensus shine.
- **Rewarded Conviction**: Collecting photos you believe in can earn crypto rewards.

JPEG transforms social media into a vibrant marketplace where creativity and taste drive value.
