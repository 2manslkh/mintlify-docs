### How It Works in 5 Steps

1. **Theme**: Receive a daily theme to inspire your photo.
2. **Capture**: Snap and submit one photo that fits the theme.
3. **Collect**: Others bet on photos they think will win by collecting them with pixels (PX).
4. **Time**: Collect early to secure a larger share of the prize pool, thanks to time decay.
5. **Prize Pool**: Win crypto rewards if your photo—or the one you collected—tops the daily contest.
