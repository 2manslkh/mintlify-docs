## Step 2: Understand the Basics

### As a Creator

**Submit Daily Themed Photos:**

1. Check today's theme (e.g., "Hydration", "My Face When...")
2. Take a photo matching the theme
3. Submit your photo
4. **Earn 100 PX immediately**

**Earn Royalties:**

- When others collect your photo, you earn 20% of all collects
- More collects = more royalties
- Royalties paid automatically

**Create Freestyle JPEGs:**

- Set your own scarcity (e.g., 1/100 limited edition)
- Set pricing in PX or cryptocurrency
- Sell directly to your audience

### As a Collector

**Collect Photos:**

1. Browse today's themed submissions
2. Choose photos you think will win
3. Collect by betting 20 PX each
4. **Earn shares** based on collection time

**Share Calculation:**

- Early collects = more shares (up to 20 shares)
- Late collects = fewer shares
- Formula: `Shares = 20 PX · (1-t)` where t is time (0-1)

**Win Rewards:**

- If your collected photo wins, receive portion of prize pool
- Prize pool = 80% of all collects
- Distributed based on your shares

## Step 3: Start Participating

### Your First Submission

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the Theme">
    Open the app and see today's themed prompt. Examples include "Hydration",
    "Round", "My Face When...", or "Boy Dinner".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take Your Photo">
    Capture a photo that matches the theme. Be creative! Unique interpretations
    stand out.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit">
    Upload your photo. You'll immediately receive 100 PX as a submission reward.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share and Promote">
    Share your photo with friends or on social media to encourage collects. More
    collects = more royalties!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Your First Collect

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse Photos">
    View all submissions for today's theme. Look for high-quality, creative
    photos.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Your Pick">
    Choose photos you think will win. Consider photo quality, creativity, and
    theme interpretation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect Early">
    The earlier you collect, the more shares you receive. But early collects
    carry higher risk.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Results">
    After 24 hours, if your collected photo wins, you'll receive a portion of
    the prize pool based on your shares.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key Concepts

### Time Decay

The time decay mechanism rewards early collectors:

| Collection Time | Shares Received  |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Hour 0 (start)  | 20 shares (100%) |
| Hour 6          | 15 shares (75%)  |
| Hour 12         | 10 shares (50%)  |
| Hour 18         | 5 shares (25%)   |
| Hour 24 (end)   | 0 shares (0%)    |

<Tip>
  Early collects yield more shares but require accurately predicting winners.
  Late collects are safer but yield fewer shares.
</Tip>

### Royalties

Creators earn 20% of all collects on their photos:

**Example:**

- 100 people collect your photo (20 PX each)
- Total: 2,000 PX
- Your royalty: 400 PX (20%)

### Prize Pool

80% of all collects fund the prize pool, distributed to collectors based on shares:

**Example:**

- 1,000 collects × 20 PX = 20,000 PX total
- Prize pool: 16,000 PX (80%)
- Creator royalties: 4,000 PX (20%)

## Tips for Success

### For Creators

✅ **Focus on Quality:** High-quality, creative photos receive more collects  
✅ **Be Unique:** Standout interpretations of themes capture attention  
✅ **Submit Consistently:** Regular submissions build a following  
✅ **Engage:** Share your photos and interact with the community  
✅ **Diversify:** Create both themed photos and freestyle JPEGs

### For Collectors

✅ **Research First:** Look at photo quality and creativity before collecting  
✅ **Diversify:** Don't put all PX on a single photo  
✅ **Understand Time Decay:** Early collects yield more but carry risk  
✅ **Follow Trends:** Monitor collect counts and trends  
✅ **Start Small:** Learn the patterns before investing heavily

<Warning>
  Collecting is speculative. Only collect with PX you can afford to lose. Past
  performance doesn't guarantee future results.
</Warning>

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I earn PX?">
    Submit themed photos (100 PX), earn royalties (20% of collects), or sell
    freestyle JPEGs. You can also receive PX from referrals (10 PX per invited
    user).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if my photo doesn't win?">
    You still earn royalties! Every collect on your photo generates 20%
    royalties, regardless of whether it wins.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I collect multiple photos?">
    Yes! You can collect as many photos as you want. Diversifying across
    multiple photos spreads risk.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between themed photos and freestyle JPEGs?">
    Themed photos are for daily contests with time decay. Freestyle JPEGs are
    market-driven assets you create with custom scarcity and pricing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I create freestyle JPEGs?">
    Set scarcity (e.g., 1/100), set price (PX or crypto), upload your photo, and
    publish. It becomes immediately available for purchase.
  </Accordion>
