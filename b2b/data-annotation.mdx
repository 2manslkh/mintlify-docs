## Overview

JPEG offers **data-annotated JPEGs** as a monetization strategy, enabling the platform to provide high-quality, precisely labeled machine learning training data to businesses and developers.

## What Is Data Annotation?

Data annotation involves labeling photos with attributes and metadata that make them useful for machine learning model training:

**Examples of Annotations:**
- Visual attributes: "urban," "minimalist," "vibrant"
- Content categories: "food," "fashion," "art"
- Emotional tone: "playful," "serious," "energetic"
- Brand alignment: "athletic," "luxury," "casual"

## How It Works

### Annotation Process

1. **Photo Submission:** Users submit themed or freestyle JPEGs
2. **Automated Annotation:** AI-assisted labeling of attributes
3. **Quality Review:** Manual verification ensures accuracy
4. **Dataset Curation:** Curated for specific use cases
5. **Purchase:** Businesses buy datasets using $JPEG tokens
