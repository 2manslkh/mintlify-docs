## Why We Built JPEG

Every day, **five billion photos** are shared online, driving massive engagement but funneling value to platforms, not creators. JPEG changes this by transforming photo sharing into a social prediction game that rewards creativity and curation.

### The Problem with Social Media

Today’s social networks prioritize algorithms over authenticity, capturing attention without compensating users. This creates three key issues:

- **Shrinking Attention Spans**: Short-form, high-stimulus content dominates, reducing depth.
- **Lower Quality of Life**: Constant comparison fuels dissatisfaction.
- **Weaker Communities**: Metrics replace genuine connection.

As platforms lean on AI-generated content, the human element—belonging and shared meaning—fades.

<Note>
  Imagine a feed where bots outnumber humans, and likes mean more than connection. That’s the trend we’re reversing.
</Note>

### A New Kind of Web

A shift is underway. Smaller, community-driven platforms like Reddit and Farcaster focus on **context**, **conversation**, and **curation**, not infinite feeds. In these spaces, attention deserves to be rewarded, not just measured.

### Our Solution: Active Curation

JPEG reimagines the social web as a system of **active curation**, not **passive scrolling**. Each photo is a mini-market where users invest in what they value:

- **Create**: Submit photos for daily themes or freestyle JPEGs.
- **Collect**: Back photos you believe will win, earning rewards if you’re right.
- **Compete**: Photos rise based on community support, not algorithms.

This aligns creativity with economic incentives, ensuring value flows to creators and curators.
