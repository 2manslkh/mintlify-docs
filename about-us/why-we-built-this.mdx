## Why We Built This

### Introduction
Every day, billions of photos are shared online, generating massive cultural value — but the economic value flows to platforms, not people. Creation is abundant, ownership is scarce. Social media optimized for growth has turned participation into performance and creators into products.

### What does this mean?
- Algorithms reward visibility over value
- Attention is captured but not compensated
- Users compete for reach instead of connection

Over time, this produces:
1. Declining attention spans
2. Declining quality of life
3. Declining community satisfaction

### The Shift
Smaller, community-driven networks are returning focus to participation and shared ownership. These spaces prioritize context, conversation, and curation. In this world, attention shouldn’t just be measured — it should be rewarded.

### Our Approach
JPEG reframes social as active curation, not passive scrolling.
- Each photo becomes a transparent market
- People back what they believe has value
- Decisions replace algorithmic feeds: what to create, what to collect, what deserves to win

This aligns cultural attention with economic incentives, creating a feedback loop between creativity, curation, and reward — moving value back to the people who create it.
