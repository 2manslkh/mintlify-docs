## True Social

### Definition

JPEG applies prediction‑market mechanics to the social web.\
Each photo becomes a small market where people can express belief in what they find meaningful, funny, or culturally relevant — through economic action, not just reaction.

> “I believe this deserves attention.”

### Core Concept

- Traditional social media uses algorithms to decide what trends.
- Visibility is based on engagement metrics like likes and shares.
- JPEG replaces that with a market‑driven system:
  - Collecting a photo = making a prediction.
  - Collective decisions, not code, determine what rises to the top.

  In JPEG, the market is the sorting mechanism.\
  The market is the algorithm

### Why It Matters

- Connects cultural attention and economic value in a transparent framework.
- Turns passive scrolling into active curation and decision‑making.
- Rewards conviction, taste, and creativity within a fair system.
