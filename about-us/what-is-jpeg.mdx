## What is JPEG

JPEG is a social prediction game. Each day, players receive a theme and post one photo that fits it. Others collect the photos they believe will win. The earlier you collect, the higher your potential reward if you’re right.

### How it works (at a glance)

- Collect photos you think will win
- Earlier collects earn more shares via time decay
- After 24 hours, the top photo wins the prize pool
