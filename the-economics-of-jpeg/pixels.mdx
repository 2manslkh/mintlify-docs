Pixels are the in-app currency used for everything that happens inside JPEG — submitting photos, collecting others, and trading freestyle JPEGs.

They're meant to feel lightweight and fun, like arcade tokens: easy to earn, easy to spend.

## How to Earn Pixels

You can get Pixels by:

- Posting a daily theme photo (base reward = 100 PX)
- Winning a daily pool
- Selling or reselling freestyle JPEGs
- Completing quests, referrals, or brand bounties

## How to Spend Pixels

You spend Pixels when you:

- Collect someone's photo (20 PX per collect)
- Buy freestyle JPEGs
- Mint new freestyle drops

Pixels circulate constantly between creators and collectors, creating a closed-loop economy where participation keeps value moving.
