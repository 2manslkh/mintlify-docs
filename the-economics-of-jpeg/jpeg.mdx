## $JPEG

$JPEG represents ownership and governance of the JPEG ecosystem.

It's the long-term layer that connects gameplay to protocol growth.

Holders of $JPEG can:

- Vote on key parameters (theme cadence, pool size, royalty splits)
- Participate in protocol proposals
- Share in the platform's upside through buyback and deflation mechanisms

Revenue from activity inside JPEG — freestyle sales, sponsorships, marketplace fees — is used to buy back and reduce the circulating supply of $JPEG, gradually concentrating value among holders who stay aligned with the platform's success.
