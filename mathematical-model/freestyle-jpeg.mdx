## Freestyle JPEGs

Freestyle JPEGs do not use time decay.

They're fixed-price, limited-edition drops entirely driven by market demand.

### Example

| Edition | Price | Total Revenue | Notes |
|---------|-------|---------------|-------|
| 1 of 100 | 10 PX | 1000 PX | All 1000 PX go to the creator |

Unlike daily JPEGs, Freestyle drops have no pool or ranking — their value comes from scarcity, collectibility, and social demand.
