## The Daily Game

JPEG’s daily game is a simple loop: **create → collect → win**. Each day, a new theme like *“Blue”* or *“Something I can’t live without”* sparks creativity. Submit a photo, collect others’ photos, and compete for crypto rewards in a 24-hour market.

### How to Play

#### Submit a Photo

<Steps>
  <Step title="Check the Theme">
    Open JPEG to see today’s prompt, like *“Blue”* or *“Something I can’t live without”*. Themes are short and open-ended to inspire creativity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Take Your Photo">
    Capture a photo that fits the theme. Unique, high-quality shots stand out.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit">
    Upload your photo to enter the contest. You’ll instantly earn 100 PX as a reward.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Share and Promote">
    Share your photo on social media or with friends to boost collects. More collects mean more royalties!
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Collect Photos

<Steps>
  <Step title="Browse Photos">
    Explore all submissions for today’s theme. Look for creative, high-quality photos.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make Your Pick">
    Choose photos you think will win based on quality, creativity, and theme fit.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Collect Early">
    Spend 20 PX to collect a photo. Early collects earn more shares due to time decay, but they’re riskier.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for Results">
    After 24 hours, if your collected photo wins, you’ll get a share of the prize pool based on your shares.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The Mechanics

- **Time Decay**: Collect early to maximize shares (up to 20 per collect). Shares decrease over 24 hours, rewarding bold predictions.
- **Prize Pool**: 80% of all collects fund the prize pool, distributed to collectors of the winning photo based on shares.
- **Royalties**: Creators earn 20% of collects on their photos as royalties, win or lose.
- **Winner**: The photo with the most weighted collects after 24 hours wins, determined by community consensus.

<Tip>
  Early collecting is high-risk, high-reward. Study photo quality and trends to make smart picks!
