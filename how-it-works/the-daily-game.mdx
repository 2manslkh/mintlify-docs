## Freestyle JPEGs & Collectibles

Freestyle JPEGs are photos that exist outside the daily theme. They’re created by users who want to post on their own terms — to share a moment, an artwork, or something meaningful without waiting for a prompt.

When you mint a freestyle JPEG, you set:

- A title and short description
- A price in Pixels (PX)
- A supply cap (for example, 1 of 10 or 1 of 100)

Anyone can collect them. Each collect works like buying a limited edition — it gives the creator royalties, and collectors can later trade or resell the JPEG on the marketplace.

Freestyle JPEGs serve two main purposes:

1. For creators and influencers: turn audience attention into ownership with limited editions.
2. For friends and casual users: share a JPEG — a moment, a joke, or an inside reference — and let people back it.

Unlike daily themes, freestyle JPEGs don’t expire after 24 hours. They live as small markets that evolve over time, shaped by social attention and collector demand.

<Tip>
  Some freestyle drops fade away. Some take off. That unpredictability is part of the fun.

### Example

<Info>
  A creator posts a freestyle JPEG titled “Last night in Tokyo.”\
  They set the price at 10 PX with 50 editions.\
  Followers collect it and it sells out in minutes.\
  The creator earns royalties, collectors hold or trade their copies, and a small cultural market forms around that single image.

### Why it matters

Freestyle JPEGs make social expression tradable. They turn fleeting online moments into something owned, backed, and remembered. In a world where attention moves fast, they give it weight.
