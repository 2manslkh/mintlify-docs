## Freestyle JPEGs & Collectibles

Freestyle JPEGs let you share photos on your own terms—outside daily themes. Mint a moment, artwork, or memory, set its price and scarcity, and let others collect it as a tradable asset. Unlike daily contests, these photos live on as evolving micro-markets driven by social attention.

### Creating a Freestyle JPEG

Mint your own Freestyle JPEG with these steps:

- **Title and Description**: Name your photo and add a short story (e.g., “Last Night in Tokyo”).
- **Price**: Set a cost in Pixels (PX), like 10 PX per edition.
- **Supply Cap**: Choose the number of editions (e.g., 1 of 10 or 1 of 100).

Once minted, your JPEG is live for anyone to collect, earning you royalties with each purchase.

### Collecting Freestyle JPEGs

Collectors can buy editions, owning a piece of the creator’s work. Each collect is like a limited-edition print:

- **Royalties**: Creators earn 20% of each collect as royalties.
- **Trading**: Collectors can hold or resell their editions on JPEG’s marketplace.
- **Value**: Prices evolve based on demand, making some JPEGs rare gems.

<Tip>
  Creators, craft unique JPEGs to stand out. Collectors, snag editions early for potential resale value!
</Tip>

### Why It Matters

Freestyle JPEGs turn fleeting moments into **tradable assets**:

- **For Creators**: Monetize your brand or art by selling limited editions to fans.
- **For Collectors**: Own a piece of culture, from influencer selfies to viral moments.
- **For Everyone**: Build a living archive of what’s meaningful, funny, or beautiful.

Unlike daily themes, Freestyle JPEGs don’t expire—they grow or fade based on community interest, forming a network of micro-markets.

<Callout title="Example: Last Night in Tokyo">
  A creator mints a Freestyle JPEG titled “Last Night in Tokyo” at 10 PX with 50 editions. It sells out in minutes, earning 100 PX in royalties (20% of 500 PX total). Collectors trade their editions, and the photo becomes a cultural snapshot in JPEG’s marketplace.
