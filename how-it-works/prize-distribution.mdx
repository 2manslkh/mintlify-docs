## Prize Distribution

Every collect in JPEG fuels a dynamic game: **80%** funds the prize pool for winners and collectors, while **20%** goes to the photo’s creator as royalties. This creates a two-sided contest rewarding both **creativity** and **prediction**.

  Picture each collect splitting instantly: most to the prize pool, a share to the creator.

### How It Works

- **Creators**: Earn 20% of every collect on your photo as royalties, win or lose. Your creativity drives income.
- **Collectors**: The prize pool (80% of collects) is distributed to those who backed the winning photo, based on shares from early collects.
- **Time Decay**: Early collectors get more shares, increasing their slice of the prize pool if their photo wins.

<Tip>
  Creators, focus on standout photos to attract collects. Collectors, time your picks early for bigger rewards!
</Tip>

### Example Breakdown

Suppose 100 people collect a photo at 20 PX each:

- **Total Collects**: 2,000 PX
- **Prize Pool**: 1,600 PX (80%)
- **Creator Royalties**: 400 PX (20%)

If the photo wins, the 1,600 PX prize pool is split among collectors based on their shares, with early collectors earning more.
