## Prize Distribution

Every collect feeds the pool:

- 80% goes to the pool of winners and collectors
- 20% goes to the photo’s creator as royalties

This creates a two-sided game — one for creativity and one for prediction.  
Creators earn from originality and creativity. Collectors earn from timing and taste.

Each collect splits between the prize pool and creator royalties, aligning incentives for both creators and collectors.
