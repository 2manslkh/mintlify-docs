## Overview

JPEG's development follows a phased approach, starting with beta testing and progressing through points removal, B2B integration, and platform optimization. Each stage focuses on specific metrics and user behaviors.

## Stage 1: Beta Test

### Objective

Validate core mechanics, test user behavior, and refine platform features with real users.

### Features

**User Incentives:**
- Testers receive points (100 PX per submission)
- $100 daily capital to play and predict
- Full platform access
- Feedback collection

**Platform Focus:**
- Core mechanics testing
- UI/UX refinement
- Bug identification and fixes
- User behavior analysis

### Target Metrics

- **Daily Active Users (DAU):** 100-500
- **Photos per Day:** 50-200 (themed and freestyle)
- **Collects per Day:** 100-500
- **Engagement Rate:** Measure user participation
- **Retention:** Track user return rates

### Beta Results

Based on testing with 100 IRL beta users:

- **Engagement Uplift:** 10-15% with quests and milestones
- **Referral Impact:** 15% DAU increase from referrals
- **User Feedback:** Positive response to core mechanics
- **Platform Refinement:** UI/UX improvements identified

<Info>
  Beta testing provides critical insights into user behavior, platform mechanics, and areas for improvement before broader launch.

## Stage 2: Points Removal

### Objective

Transition from incentivized testing to sustainable economic model based on royalties and freestyle sales.

### Changes

**Submission Rewards:**
- Points for submissions end
- Users rely on royalties and freestyle sales
- Natural PX distribution through economic activity

**Platform Focus:**
- Economic sustainability
- User retention without points
- Creator monetization
- Speculator engagement

### Target Metrics

- **A-to-B Transition Rate:** 20-30% of creators become speculators
- **Retention Rate:** 60-80% user retention
- **Prediction Accuracy:** 40-60% (early collects aligning with winners)
- **Economic Activity:** Self-sustaining collect and trade volumes
- **Creator Earnings:** Sustainable royalty income

### Key Indicators

**Success Metrics:**
- Users continue participating without point rewards
- Royalties provide sufficient creator incentives
- Collect activity remains high
- Platform economics are sustainable

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Monitor retention carefully
- Adjust mechanisms if needed
- Ensure creator value
- Maintain speculator engagement

<Warning>
  Stage 2 is critical—removing points tests whether the economic model can sustain user engagement. Careful monitoring and potential adjustments are essential.
</Warning>

## Stage 3: B2B Integration

### Objective

Integrate brand partnerships, bounties, and B2B services to create additional revenue streams and expand platform value.

### Features

**Brand Campaigns:**
- Companies set branded themes (e.g., Nike's "Just Do It")
- Bounties for themed content
- Sponsored freestyle JPEG collections
- Brand-specific curation

**B2B Services:**
- Data annotation services
- Curated dataset sales
- Custom campaign management
- Analytics and reporting

### Target Metrics

- **Bounty Participation:** 10-20% of users
- **Submissions per Bounty:** 50-100 photos per $500 bounty
- **B2B Revenue:** Sustainable revenue from brands
- **Platform Growth:** Brand-driven user acquisition
- **Data Sales:** Revenue from annotated datasets

### Success Indicators

**For Brands:**
- High-quality UGC generation
- Strong ROI on campaigns
- Positive brand association
- Repeat partnerships

**For Platform:**
- Sustainable revenue streams
- Platform fee collection
- $JPEG deflation through profits
- Scalable B2B operations
