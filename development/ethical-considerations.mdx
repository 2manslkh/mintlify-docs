## Overview

JPEG is committed to ethical platform design, ensuring user privacy, fair reward distribution, and responsible data usage. This commitment guides platform development and operations.

## User Privacy

### Photo Metadata Anonymization

**Protection Measures:**
- Photo metadata anonymized before processing
- Location data removed or generalized
- Device information stripped
- Personal identifiers removed

**User Control:**
- Users can request metadata removal
- Privacy settings available
- Opt-out options for data usage
- Transparent data practices

<Info>
  Privacy protection is fundamental to JPEG's design. User data is handled with care and respect for individual privacy rights.
</Info>

### GDPR Compliance

**European Union Regulations:**
- Right to access personal data
- Right to deletion
- Data portability
- Consent management
- Privacy by design

**Implementation:**
- Clear privacy policies
- User consent mechanisms
- Data protection measures
- Regular compliance audits

### Photo Ownership Considerations

**Company Ownership:**
- All submitted photos become company-owned assets
- Clear terms of service
- User awareness and consent
- Rights and limitations explained

**Balancing Interests:**
- Platform sustainability needs
- User rights protection
- Regulatory compliance
- Ethical data usage

<Warning>
  Photo ownership enables platform operations, but users should understand their rights and the platform's usage of their content.
</Warning>

## Fair Reward Distribution

### Preventing Concentration

**Problem:** Traditional platforms see 10% of creators capturing 90% of revenue (e.g., Instagram)

**JPEG's Approach:**
- Transparent on-chain mechanics
- Algorithmic monitoring
- Multiple monetization paths
- Lower barriers to earning

**Mechanisms:**
- Royalties based on collects (not algorithms)
- Fair share distribution
- Platform limits prevent domination
- Equal opportunities for all users

### Algorithmic Fairness

**Transparency:**
- Clear reward mechanisms
- Visible collect and trade data
- Predictable distribution formulas
- No hidden algorithms

**Monitoring:**
- Track reward distribution
- Identify concentration risks
- Adjust mechanisms as needed
- Ensure fair access

- Transparent data practices

### Data Annotation Ethics

**Annotation Practices:**
- High-quality, accurate labeling
- Respect for user content
- Ethical use of annotations
- Responsible data sales

**Business Use:**
- Legitimate ML training purposes
- No harmful applications
- Respect for user rights
- Ethical AI development

### Research Ethics

**User Research:**

## Platform Manipulation Prevention

### Detection and Prevention

**Anomaly Detection:**
- Flag suspicious patterns
- Detect coordinated behavior
- Prevent vote rigging
- Stop pump-and-dump schemes

**User Protection:**
