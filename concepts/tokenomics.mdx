## Dual Token System

JPEG introduces a dual token system to balance user engagement and investor speculation, creating a sustainable economic ecosystem.

## Pixels (PX)

### Purpose

Pixels (PX) is an **in-game token** designed for platform interactions:

- Themed photo collects (20 PX per collect)
- Freestyle JPEG purchases
- Submission rewards (100 PX per submission)

### Design Philosophy

PX is designed to feel **non-financialized** for users:
- Low psychological barrier to entry
- Focused on gameplay and engagement
- May operate off-chain for simplicity
- Or on-chain for transparency

### Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Daily Submissions" icon="camera">
    Earn 100 PX immediately upon submitting a themed photo
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Collecting Photos" icon="hand-pointer">
    Spend 20 PX to collect a photo and bet on it winning
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Freestyle JPEGs" icon="image">
    Purchase freestyle JPEGs priced in PX
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Royalties" icon="coins">
    Receive PX as royalties (20% of collects on your photos)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## $JPEG Token

### Purpose

$JPEG is a **governance token** for investors, enabling speculation on the platform's success.

### Functions

- **On-ramp/Off-ramp:** Primary financial transaction token
- **Governance:** Platform decision-making (future)
- **Value Capture:** Trading volume and platform fees influence value
- **Deflationary Mechanism:** Profits reinvested to reduce circulating supply

### Economic Model

**Value Drivers:**
- Platform trading volume
- Freestyle JPEG sales
- B2B bounty participation
- Overall platform growth

**Deflationary Pressure:**
- Profits from app (freestyle sales, bounties) reinvested
- Reduces circulating supply
- Increases token value over time

<Info>
  This system aligns user incentives with investor interests, fostering a sustainable economic ecosystem.

## Economic Flows

### Revenue Distribution

**Themed Photo Collects:**
- 80% → Prize pool (distributed to collectors)
- 20% → Creator royalties

**Freestyle JPEG Sales:**
- 100% → Creator (direct sale)
- Platform may take fees (funding $JPEG deflation)

**B2B Bounties:**
- Bounty amount → Prize pool
- Platform fee → $JPEG deflation

### Example Revenue Table

| Transaction | Creator Revenue | Prize Pool | Platform |
|-------------|----------------|------------|----------|
| 100 themed collects at 20 PX | 400 PX (20%) | 1,600 PX (80%) | - |
| 50 freestyle JPEGs at 10 PX | 500 PX (direct) | - | Fee % |
| $500 bounty | Variable | Bounty amount | Fee % |

## Token Distribution Strategy

### Stage 1: Beta Test
- Testers receive points and $100 daily capital
- Focus on engagement and testing mechanics
- PX distributed liberally to encourage participation

### Stage 2: Points Removal
- Points for submissions end
- Reliance on royalties and freestyle sales
- Natural PX distribution through economic activity

### Stage 3: B2B Integration
- Brands fund bounties in $JPEG or fiat
- Platform fees contribute to $JPEG deflation
- Sustainable revenue model established

## Deflationary Mechanism

Profits from the platform are reinvested to create deflationary pressure on $JPEG:

```
Revenue Sources:
- Freestyle JPEG platform fees
- B2B bounty fees
- Data annotation sales

Reinvestment:
- Buy back $JPEG tokens
- Reduce circulating supply
- Increase token value
```

This creates a **positive feedback loop**:
- More platform activity → More fees → More buybacks → Higher token value → More platform activity

<Warning>
  Deflationary mechanisms depend on sustained platform profitability. Success requires maintaining user engagement and B2B partnerships.
</Warning>

## Economic Incentives

### For Creators

- **Submission Reward:** 100 PX (immediate)
- **Royalties:** 20% of collects on your photos
- **Freestyle Sales:** Direct revenue from JPEG sales
- **Bounty Participation:** Additional rewards for brand themes

### For Collectors

- **Prize Pool Shares:** Early collects yield more shares
- **Winning Predictions:** Share of prize pool based on shares
- **Freestyle Trading:** Profit from JPEG appreciation

### For Investors

- **$JPEG Appreciation:** Deflationary mechanism increases value
- **Governance Rights:** Future platform decision-making
- **Trading Volume:** Increased activity drives value

## Projected Economics

Based on beta testing and market analysis:

- **Stage 2 DAU:** 1,500-3,000 (based on BeReal metrics)
- **A-to-B Transition:** 20-30% of creators become speculators
- **Freestyle Revenue Increase:** 25% (based on NFT market analogies)
- **Prize Pool (2,000 collects):** 800 PX with exponential decay

<Tip>
  The dual token system creates a balanced ecosystem where users focus on engagement (PX) while investors participate in platform growth ($JPEG).
