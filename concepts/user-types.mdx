description: "Understanding the different user personas and their motivations"

## Overview

JPEG serves two primary user types, each with distinct motivations and behaviors. Understanding these personas helps explain the platform's economic dynamics and user journey.

## User A: Content Creators

### Characteristics

User A enjoys creative photo sharing and submits daily theme photos or freestyle JPEGs. They are similar to BeReal users in their desire for authentic, spontaneous expression.

### Motivations

**Intrinsic Rewards:**
- Social validation
- Creative self-expression
- Community engagement
- Personal satisfaction from creating compelling content

**Extrinsic Rewards:**
- 100 PX per submission
- 20% royalties on collects
- Direct sales from freestyle JPEGs

### Behavior Patterns

- Regular daily submissions to themed prompts
- Focus on photo quality and creativity
- Engagement with community through comments and tags
- Building a personal brand through freestyle JPEGs

<Info>
  User A is intrinsically motivated by creative expression, deriving joy from social validation while also benefiting from financial rewards.

## User B: Speculators

### Characteristics

User B are often crypto enthusiasts or trend-spotters who predict winning photos in themed collects or trade freestyle JPEGs as assets.

### Motivations

**Primary Drivers:**
- Financial gain
- Overconfidence bias (believing they can predict winners)
- Maximizing returns through strategic timing
- Market trading opportunities

### Behavior Patterns

- Early collects on promising photos (to maximize shares)
- Analysis of trends and popularity signals
- Trading freestyle JPEGs based on scarcity and market dynamics
- Strategic diversification across multiple collects

<Warning>
  Early collects carry higher risk—you're betting before outcomes are clear. Late collects are safer but yield fewer shares.
</Warning>

## User Evolution: A-to-B Transition

### The Transition Path

Royalties and freestyle JPEG sales enable User A to accumulate capital (pixels or crypto), naturally transitioning into User B's speculative role.

### Psychological Factors

**Endowment Effect:**
The endowment effect suggests people ascribe higher value to items they own. In JPEG:
- Users overvalue earned PX from royalties
- Owned freestyle JPEGs feel more valuable
- This increases willingness to speculate

**Motivation Bridge:**
JPEG's royalties and freestyle sales bridge intrinsic and extrinsic motivations:
- Creators stay engaged for creative reasons
- Financial rewards encourage continued participation
- Enhanced retention across user types

### Economic Cycle

This creates a **cyclical economy**:

```
Creation → Royalties → Capital Accumulation → Speculation → More Creation
```

## User Statistics

Based on beta testing and projections:

- **A-to-B Transition Rate:** 20-30% (Stage 2)
- **User A Retention:** High (intrinsic + extrinsic motivation)
- **User B Engagement:** Very high (financial incentives)
- **Dual Role Users:** Growing segment participating in both creation and speculation

## Design Implications
