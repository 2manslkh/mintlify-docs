## Overview

JPEG transforms photo popularity into a prediction market where users bet on which photos will win daily contests. This capital-backed mechanism ensures fair rewards and reveals true creative resonance.

## Core Mechanism

### Collecting Photos

Users "collect" photos by betting 20 PX each, predicting which photo will win the day's popularity contest.

### Time Decay Formula

The time decay mechanism rewards early risk-takers:

```
Shares = px · (1-t)
```

Where:
- `px` = collect value (20 PX)
- `t` = normalized time over 24 hours (0 = start, 1 = end)
- `Shares` = effective value in the prediction market

### Example Calculation

If you collect a photo at different times:

| Time | Normalized Time (t) | Shares Received |
|------|---------------------|----------------|
| Hour 0 | 0.0 | 20 shares |
| Hour 6 | 0.25 | 15 shares |
| Hour 12 | 0.5 | 10 shares |
| Hour 18 | 0.75 | 5 shares |
| Hour 24 | 1.0 | 0 shares |

<Info>
  Early collects yield more shares but carry higher risk—you're betting before outcomes are clear. Late collects are safer but yield fewer shares.
</Info>

## Alternative: Exponential Decay

An alternative exponential decay model may be implemented:

```
Shares = px · e^(-kt)
```

Where `k` is a decay constant (e.g., k=0.1).

**Benefits:**
- Smoother value decay
- May increase late collects by 15% (based on simulations)
- More gradual reduction in share value

## Prize Pool Distribution

### Formula

The expected prize pool is calculated as:

```
Prize Pool = 0.8 · N · V · ∫₀¹(1-t)dt = 0.4 · N · V
```

Where:
- `N` = number of collects
- `V` = value per collect (20 PX)
- `0.8` = 80% allocated to prize pool

### Example

For 2,000 collects at 1 PX each:
- Prize pool: 800 PX (80%)
- Creator royalties: 200 PX (20%)

### Distribution

Prize pool is distributed to collectors based on their shares:
- Higher shares = larger portion of prize pool
- Winners are determined by total shares across all collects

## Strategic Considerations

### Early Collect Strategy

**Pros:**
- Maximum shares per collect
- Higher potential returns if photo wins

**Cons:**
- Higher uncertainty
- Risk of backing a losing photo
- Capital locked in until contest ends

### Late Collect Strategy

**Pros:**
- More information available
- Can identify trending photos
- Lower risk

**Cons:**
- Fewer shares per collect
- Lower potential returns
- May miss early price advantages

### Diversification

Many successful collectors diversify:
- Multiple collects across different photos
- Mix of early and late collects
- Balance risk and reward

<Warning>
  Over-concentration in a single photo increases risk. Diversification helps manage exposure.
</Warning>

## True Social Concept

JPEG's prediction market embodies the **"True Social"** concept:

## Market Dynamics

### Non-Cooperative Game

Early and late collects create a non-cooperative game dynamic:
- Users strategize independently
- Early collects yield more but risk misjudgment
- Late collects diversify but earn less

### Freestyle JPEG Trading

Freestyle JPEGs introduce speculative market dynamics similar to NFT markets:
- Users strategize based on scarcity
- Market trends influence trading decisions
- Value is market-driven (no time decay)

## Prediction Accuracy

Based on beta testing:
- **Prediction Accuracy:** 40-60% (early collects aligning with winners)
- This suggests users can identify quality content early
- Market efficiency improves with more participants

<Tip>
  Successful prediction requires understanding both photo quality and community preferences. Early identification of promising content is key to maximizing returns.
