## The Social Prediction Game

JPEG combines three powerful elements into a single platform:

1. **Social Photo Sharing** - Daily themed prompts inspire creative submissions
2. **Prediction Market** - Users bet on which photos will win
3. **Economic Rewards** - Creators earn royalties, collectors earn from prize pools

## Daily Theme Flow

### Step 1: Submit Your Photo

Each day, users are presented with a themed prompt (e.g., "Hydration", "My Face When...", "Round"). Users submit a single photo that matches the theme.

**Reward:** Earn 100 PX immediately upon submission.

### Step 2: Others Collect Your Photo

Other users can "collect" photos by betting 20 PX each, predicting which photo will win the day's popularity contest.

### Step 3: Time Decay Mechanism

The earlier someone collects, the more shares they receive:

```
Shares = px · (1-t)
```

Where:
- `px` = collect value (20 PX)
- `t` = normalized time (0 at start, 1 at 24 hours)

**Example:**
- Collect at hour 0: 20 shares
- Collect at hour 12: 10 shares  
- Collect at hour 24: 0 shares

This creates strategic risk—early collects yield more shares but carry higher uncertainty.

### Step 4: Prize Distribution

At the end of 24 hours, the most popular photo wins:

- **80%** of all collects → Prize pool (distributed to collectors based on shares)
- **20%** of all collects → Creator royalties

## Freestyle JPEGs

Beyond daily themes, users can create **freestyle JPEGs**:

- Set your own scarcity (e.g., limited to 100 editions)
- Set pricing in PX or cryptocurrency
- JPEGs become tradable assets on the platform
- No time decay—value is market-driven

This enables influencers and artists to monetize their personal brand directly.

## True Social Concept

JPEG's innovation lies in its **"True Social"** concept: capital flows reveal the truth of creative resonance. Just like Polymarket uses financial stakes to aggregate collective wisdom, JPEG's collects create a capital-backed mechanism where the most compelling photos naturally rise to the top.

<Note>
  This ensures fair rewards—popularity isn't just about likes, but about people putting their money where their mouth is.

## User Types

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="User A: Content Creators" icon="camera">
    Enjoy creative photo sharing and submit daily theme photos or freestyle JPEGs. Motivated by social validation and extrinsic rewards (royalties, direct sales). Seek self-expression and community engagement.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User B: Speculators" icon="chart-line">
    Predict winning photos in themed collects or trade freestyle JPEGs as assets. Driven by financial gain, aiming to maximize returns through early collects or market trades.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="A-to-B Transition" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Royalties and freestyle JPEG sales enable creators to accumulate capital, transitioning into speculators. This creates a cyclical economy of creation and trading.

## Example Scenario

1. **Morning:** Daily theme "Hydration" is announced
2. **Throughout the day:** 200 users submit photos, earning 100 PX each
3. **Collections:** 1,000 collects happen (20 PX each = 20,000 PX total)
4. **Prize pool:** 16,000 PX (80%) distributed to collectors based on shares
5. **Creator royalties:** 4,000 PX (20%) split among creators
6. **Winner:** Most collected photo receives the largest share of prize pool

<Tip>
  Early collects on the winning photo yield the highest returns, but require accurately predicting popularity before it's obvious.
