## Overview

Freestyle JPEGs allow users to create their own digital assets with custom scarcity and pricing. Unlike themed photos, freestyle JPEGs are market-driven assets that can be traded, enabling influencers and artists to monetize their personal brand directly.

## Key Differences from Themed Photos

| Feature | Themed Photos | Freestyle JPEGs |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Scarcity** | Unlimited submissions | User-set (e.g., 1/100) |
| **Pricing** | Free (earn 100 PX) | User-set (PX or crypto) |
| **Time Decay** | Yes (collects decay over 24h) | No (market-driven) |
| **Purpose** | Daily contest participation | Asset creation & trading |
| **Revenue** | 20% royalties + 100 PX | 100% direct sales |

## Creating Freestyle JPEGs

### Step 1: Set Scarcity

Choose how many editions to create:
- **1/1** - Unique, one-of-a-kind
- **1/10** - Limited edition of 10
- **1/100** - Limited edition of 100
- Or any number you choose

<Info>
  Scarcity creates perceived value. Limited editions often command higher prices.
</Info>

### Step 2: Set Price

Price your JPEG in:
- **Pixels (PX)** - In-game currency
- **Cryptocurrency** - Direct crypto payment
- **$JPEG** - Governance token

### Step 3: Upload & Publish

Upload your photo and publish your freestyle JPEG. It becomes immediately available for purchase.

## Trading Dynamics

Freestyle JPEGs operate like NFT marketplaces:

- **Primary Sales:** Direct purchase from creator
- **Secondary Trading:** JPEGs can be resold
- **Market Value:** Determined by supply, demand, and creator reputation
- **Scarcity Premium:** Limited editions often appreciate

Based on NFT market analogies:

- **Freestyle JPEG trading** projected to increase creator revenue by 25%
- Market dynamics similar to meme-based cryptocurrency markets
- Early adopters and established creators see highest returns

## Examples

### Scenario 1: Emerging Creator

1. Create 1/100 edition at 10 PX each
2. Sell 50 copies = 500 PX revenue
3. Remaining 50 copies may appreciate
4. Build reputation for future releases

### Scenario 2: Established Influencer

1. Create 1/10 limited edition at 100 PX each
2. Sell all 10 copies = 1,000 PX revenue
3. Secondary market trading increases value
4. Next release commands premium pricing

## B2B Applications

Brands can sponsor freestyle JPEG collections:

- **Branded Collections:** Limited edition JPEGs featuring brand themes
- **Influencer Partnerships:** Collaborate with creators
- **Data-Annotated JPEGs:** Purchase labeled datasets for ML training

<Note>

</Note>

## Best Practices

### For Creators

<Tip>
  **Start Accessible:** Begin with lower prices to build an audience, then increase for limited editions.
</Tip>

- Set realistic scarcity (1/100 is more accessible than 1/1)
- Price competitively at launch
- Build reputation through quality
- Create series to build collector base

### For Traders

- Research creator reputation
- Understand scarcity value
- Monitor market trends
- Diversify your portfolio

<Warning>
  Market value can fluctuate. Only invest what you can afford to lose. Scarcity doesn't guarantee value—community demand does.
</Warning>

## Platform Benefits

Freestyle JPEGs create a sustainable revenue model:

- **For Users:** Multiple monetization paths
- **For Platform:** Trading fees fund $JPEG deflation
- **For Ecosystem:** Creates vibrant marketplace dynamics
