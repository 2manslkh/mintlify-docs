## Overview

Daily themed photos are the core social mechanic of JPEG. Each day, users are presented with a themed prompt and submit a single photo, transforming passive photo-taking into an engaging, economically-rewarded activity.

## How It Works

### Daily Themes

Themes range from simple concepts to creative prompts:
- "Hydration"
- "My Face When..."
- "Round"
- "Boy Dinner"
- And many more...

### Submission Process

1. **View the Theme** - Check today's prompt
2. **Capture Your Photo** - Take a photo matching the theme
3. **Submit** - Upload your single daily submission
4. **Earn Reward** - Receive 100 PX immediately

<Info>
  You can only submit one photo per day per theme. Choose wisely!
</Info>

### Collection Period

After submission, your photo enters a 24-hour collection period where others can collect it by betting 20 PX each.

## Rewards

### Submission Reward

**100 PX** earned immediately upon submission, regardless of performance.

### Creator Royalties

Earn **20% of all collects** on your photo:
- If 100 people collect your photo (20 PX each)
- Total collects: 2,000 PX
- Your royalty: 400 PX (20%)

### Winning Bonus

If your photo wins (most collects), collectors receive shares of the prize pool. While creators don't directly receive prize pool winnings, winning photos typically receive more collects, increasing your royalties.
