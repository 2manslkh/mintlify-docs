description: "How creators earn royalties from their photos"

## Overview

Royalties are a core revenue stream for creators on JPEG. When others collect your photos, you earn 20% of all collect value as royalties, creating a sustainable income stream from your creative work.

## How Royalties Work

### The Mechanism

When someone collects your photo (bets 20 PX), the collect value is split:

- **80%** → Prize pool (distributed to collectors if photo wins)
- **20%** → Creator royalties (you!)

### Example Calculation

**Scenario:** 100 people collect your photo

```
Total Collects: 100 × 20 PX = 2,000 PX
Your Royalty: 2,000 PX × 20% = 400 PX
Prize Pool: 2,000 PX × 80% = 1,600 PX
```

<Info>
  Royalties are paid regardless of whether your photo wins. Every collect generates revenue for you.

## Royalty Rates

### Themed Photos

**Rate:** 20% of all collects

This applies to all daily themed photo submissions.

### Freestyle JPEGs

**Rate:** 100% of primary sales (direct sale)

Freestyle JPEGs work differently—you set the price and receive 100% of primary sales. Secondary trading may include royalties (platform-dependent).

## Revenue Examples

### Example 1: Popular Photo

- **Collections:** 500 collects × 20 PX = 10,000 PX total
- **Your Royalty:** 10,000 PX × 20% = **2,000 PX**
- **Prize Pool:** 10,000 PX × 80% = 8,000 PX

### Example 2: Average Photo

- **Collections:** 50 collects × 20 PX = 1,000 PX total
- **Your Royalty:** 1,000 PX × 20% = **200 PX**
- **Prize Pool:** 1,000 PX × 80% = 800 PX

### Example 3: Niche Photo

- **Collections:** 10 collects × 20 PX = 200 PX total
- **Your Royalty:** 200 PX × 20% = **40 PX**
- **Prize Pool:** 200 PX × 80% = 160 PX

  <Accordion title="Quality Over Quantity" icon="star">
    High-quality, creative photos receive more collects. Focus on making each submission count.

### Revenue Projections

Based on platform metrics:

- **Average Photo:** 50-100 collects = 200-400 PX royalties
- **Popular Photo:** 200-500 collects = 800-2,000 PX royalties
- **Viral Photo:** 500+ collects = 2,000+ PX royalties

<Tip>
  Royalties compound over time. Consistent quality submissions build a portfolio that generates ongoing revenue.
</Tip>

## Royalty Distribution

### Automatic Payment

Royalties are distributed automatically:
- Paid in PX (Pixels)
- Received after collection period ends
- No manual claiming required

### Accumulation

Royalties accumulate in your wallet:
- View total earnings in dashboard
- Use PX for collects or freestyle purchases
- Build capital for speculation

## Royalties and User Evolution

Royalties enable the **A-to-B transition**:

1. **User A (Creator):** Submits photos, earns royalties
2. **Capital Accumulation:** Royalties build PX reserves
3. **User B (Speculator):** Uses PX for collects and trading
4. **Cyclical Economy:** Profits reinvested into more creation

<Card title="The Cycle" icon="arrows-rotate">
  Creation → Royalties → Capital → Speculation → More Creation
</Card>

## Fair Distribution

### Transparency

JPEG ensures fair royalty distribution through:
- Transparent on-chain mechanics
- Algorithmic monitoring
- Prevention of top creator domination

### Statistics

Research shows that on traditional platforms, 10% of creators capture 90% of revenue. JPEG's mechanisms aim to prevent this concentration:

- Royalties based on collects, not platform algorithms
- Multiple monetization paths (royalties + freestyle + bounties)
- Lower barriers to earning

<Note>
  Fair distribution doesn't mean equal distribution—high-quality creators still earn more. But the system prevents extreme concentration.
</Note>

## Comparing Revenue Streams

| Revenue Source | Rate | Consistency | Potential |
|----------------|------|------------|----------|
| **Submission Reward** | 100 PX | Every submission | Low |
| **Royalties** | 20% of collects | Variable | Medium-High |
| **Freestyle Sales** | 100% of price | Market-dependent | High |
| **Bounty Rewards** | Variable | Event-based | High |

### Combined Revenue

Successful creators leverage multiple streams:

- Daily submissions: 100 PX × 30 days = 3,000 PX/month
- Royalties: 200-2,000 PX/month (varies)
- Freestyle sales: Variable, potentially high
- **Total:** Sustainable income from creative work

## Best Practices

### For Creators

✅ Focus on quality over quantity  
✅ Submit consistently  
✅ Engage with community  
✅ Build recognizable brand  
✅ Diversify revenue streams  

### Maximizing Collections

- Create standout photos
- Promote your submissions
- Engage with collectors
- Build a following
- Experiment with styles

<Warning>
  Don't rely solely on royalties. Diversify with freestyle JPEGs and other revenue streams for sustainable income.
</Warning>

## Future Considerations

### Potential Adjustments

The platform may adjust royalty splits:
- **Current:** 20% creator, 80% prize pool
- **Possible:** 25% creator, 75% prize pool (mentioned in risks/mitigation)

Any changes would be communicated transparently and based on platform health metrics.

<Tip>
  Royalties create a sustainable creator economy. Focus on building quality content, and the collections (and royalties) will follow.
