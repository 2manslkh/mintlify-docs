## What Are Collects?

Collecting is the core prediction mechanism of JPEG. Users "collect" photos by betting 20 PX each, predicting which photo will win the day's popularity contest.

## How Collecting Works

### The Process

1. **Browse Photos** - View all submissions for today's theme
2. **Choose Your Pick** - Select photos you think will win
3. **Collect** - Bet 20 PX on each photo
4. **Earn Shares** - Receive shares based on collection time
5. **Win Rewards** - If photo wins, receive portion of prize pool

### Share Calculation

Shares are calculated using the time decay formula:

```
Shares = px · (1-t)
```

Where:
- `px` = 20 PX (collect value)
- `t` = normalized time (0 at start, 1 at 24 hours)

## Time Decay Impact

The earlier you collect, the more shares you receive:

| Collection Time | Normalized Time | Shares | Percentage of Max |
|----------------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| Hour 0 | 0.0 | 20 | 100% |
| Hour 6 | 0.25 | 15 | 75% |
| Hour 12 | 0.5 | 10 | 50% |
| Hour 18 | 0.75 | 5 | 25% |
| Hour 24 | 1.0 | 0 | 0% |

<Info>
  This creates strategic tension: early collects yield more shares but carry higher uncertainty. Late collects are safer but yield fewer shares.

## Prize Pool Distribution

### How It Works

**Total Collects:** 1,000 collects × 20 PX = 20,000 PX

**Distribution:**
- **80% (16,000 PX)** → Prize pool (distributed to collectors)
- **20% (4,000 PX)** → Creator royalties

### Share-Based Payouts

Prize pool is distributed proportionally based on shares:

```
Your Payout = (Your Total Shares / All Winning Shares) × Prize Pool
```

**Example:**
- You collected the winning photo at hour 0: 20 shares
- Total shares on winning photo: 200 shares
- Prize pool: 16,000 PX
- Your payout: (20/200) × 16,000 = 1,600 PX

<Note>
  Multiple collects on the same photo sum your shares. Diversifying across photos spreads risk.
</Note>

## Collection Strategies

### Early Collection Strategy

**Pros:**
- Maximum shares per collect (20 shares)
- Higher potential returns
- First-mover advantage

**Cons:**
- Higher uncertainty
- Risk of backing losing photos
- Capital locked until contest ends

**Best For:**
- Users confident in their judgment
- Those seeking maximum returns
- Risk-tolerant speculators

### Late Collection Strategy

**Pros:**
- More information available
- Can identify trending photos
- Lower risk

**Cons:**
- Fewer shares per collect
- Lower potential returns
- May miss early advantages

**Best For:**
- Risk-averse users
- Those wanting more certainty
- Users with limited capital

### Diversification Strategy

**Approach:**
- Multiple collects across different photos
- Mix of early and late collects
- Balance risk and reward

**Example:**
- 5 early collects (20 shares each) = 100 shares
- 10 late collects (5 shares each) = 50 shares
- Total: 150 shares across 15 photos

<Tip>
  Diversification helps manage risk. Don't put all your PX on a single photo unless you're very confident.

## Predicting Winners

### Factors to Consider

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Photo Quality" icon="image">
    High-quality, creative photos tend to win. Look for standout visuals.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Theme Interpretation" icon="lightbulb">
    Unique takes on themes capture attention. Avoid generic submissions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Creator Reputation" icon="star">
    Established creators often have followings that collect their photos.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Early Collections" icon="chart-line">
    Photos with many early collects may signal winner potential.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Social Signals" icon="users">
    Photos being shared or discussed may indicate popularity.

### Prediction Accuracy

Based on beta testing:
- **Early collects aligning with winners:** 40-60%
- Suggests users can identify quality content early
- Market efficiency improves with more participants

## Economic Considerations

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Cost per Collect:** 20 PX

**Potential Returns:**
- Early collect on winner: High (depends on total shares)
- Late collect on winner: Lower but safer
- Collect on loser: 0 PX (capital lost)

**Expected Value:**
```
EV = (Probability of Win × Payout) - 20 PX
```

<Warning>
  Collecting is speculative. Only collect with PX you can afford to lose. Past performance doesn't guarantee future results.
</Warning>

## Alternative: Exponential Decay

The platform may implement exponential decay:

```
Shares = px · e^(-kt)
```

Where `k` is a decay constant (e.g., k=0.1).

**Benefits:**
- Smoother value decay
- May increase late collects by 15%
- More gradual reduction in share value

## Platform Limits

To prevent market domination:
- **Collect caps per user** may be implemented
- **Anomaly detection** flags suspicious activity
- Accounts with >50% of collects on single photo may be flagged

## Best Practices

### Do's

✅ Research photos before collecting  
✅ Diversify across multiple photos  
✅ Consider both early and late strategies  
✅ Monitor trends throughout the day  
✅ Only collect with PX you can afford to lose  

### Don'ts

❌ Don't collect randomly without research  
❌ Don't put all PX on a single photo  
❌ Don't ignore time decay implications  
❌ Don't collect based solely on early signals  
❌ Don't expect guaranteed returns  

<Tip>
  Successful collecting requires understanding photo quality, community preferences, and strategic timing. Start small, learn the patterns, then scale your strategy.
