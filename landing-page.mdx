## What is JPEG?

Billions of JPEGs are taken every day. What if taking one could make you money?

JPEG is a pioneering social game that transforms photo sharing into a dynamic prediction market, blending BeReal's spontaneous creativity with robust financial incentives. Each day, users are presented with themed prompts ranging from "Hydration" to "My Face When..." and submit a single photo, earning 100 pixels (PX) as an initial reward.

## Key Features

### Themed Photos & Daily Contests

Submit photos for daily themes and compete for crypto rewards. Others "collect" your photos by betting 20 PX each, predicting which photo will win the day's popularity contest.

### Prediction Market

Earlier collects yield a higher share of the prize pool due to a time decay mechanism, introducing strategic risk and reward. 80% of collects fund the prize pool, while creators earn 20% as royalties.

### Freestyle JPEGs

Create freestyle JPEGs with set scarcity and prices, tradable as assets. This enables influencers and artists to monetize their personal brand directly.

### True Social

Inspired by Polymarket's capital-backed prediction model, JPEG's "True Social" concept ensures that capital flows reveal the truth of creative resonance—the most compelling photos rise to the top.
