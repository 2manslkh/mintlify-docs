## JPEG Whitepaper Version 2.0

**Author:** Danny Vayne  
**Date:** October 18, 2025

## Abstract

Billions of JPEGs are taken every day. What if taking one could make you money? JPEG is a social prediction game blending BeReal-style photo sharing with a prediction market, powered by Base, an Ethereum Layer 2. Users submit photos for daily themes, earning 100 pixels (PX) per submission, while others "collect" them to bet on the day's winner, with earlier collects yielding more shares but carrying higher risk. Collects fuel a prize pool, creators earn 20% royalties, and the most popular photo wins crypto rewards. Beyond daily themes, users can create freestyle JPEGs with set scarcity and prices, tradable as assets, enabling influencer monetization. Inspired by Polymarket, JPEG introduces "True Social"- a concept where truth is backed by money, ensuring fair rewards through capital flows. It serves as a UGC engine for brands, fostering heuristic value around attention like MrBeast's model. This whitepaper explores JPEG's detailed mechanics, economic incentives, user psychology, novelty, and its potential as a viral, brand-driven platform, leveraging behavioral economics, game theory, and non-game enjoyment paradigms for clean, intuitive UI/UX.

## Key Highlights

### Innovation

JPEG's innovation lies in its **"True Social"** concept, inspired by Polymarket's capital-backed prediction model. Capital flows through collects reveal the truth of creative resonance—the most compelling photos rise to the top, ensuring fair rewards.

### Economic Model

**Dual Token System:**
- **Pixels (PX):** In-game token for collects and purchases
- **$JPEG:** Governance token for investors with deflationary mechanism

**Revenue Distribution:**
- 80% of collects → Prize pool
- 20% of collects → Creator royalties
- Freestyle JPEGs → 100% direct sales to creators

### Platform Statistics

- **Waitlist:** 220,000+ signups (as of October 2025)
- **Beta Engagement Uplift:** 10-15% (with quests and milestones)
- **Referral DAU Increase:** 15% (beta tests)
- **Target Stage 2 DAU:** 1,500-3,000

### Research Foundation

The whitepaper draws from:
- Behavioral economics (loss aversion, social proof, endowment effect)
- Game theory (non-cooperative games, strategic behavior)
- Prospect theory and self-determination theory
- NFT market analogies and SocialFi trends
