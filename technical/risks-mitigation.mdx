## Overview

JPEG operates in a complex ecosystem involving social dynamics, economic incentives, and speculative behavior. Identifying and mitigating risks ensures platform sustainability and user protection.

## Market Domination

### Risk

A small number of users could dominate collects and trades, concentrating rewards and reducing platform diversity.

### Mitigation Strategies

**Collect Caps:**
- Limit collects per user per photo
- Prevent extreme concentration
- Ensure diverse participation

**Trade Limits:**
- Cap trades per user for freestyle JPEGs
- Prevent market manipulation
- Maintain fair distribution

**Anomaly Detection:**
- Flag accounts with >50% of collects on single photo
- Monitor for coordinated behavior
- Automated alerts for suspicious patterns

<Info>
  Caps and limits are calibrated to prevent domination while allowing legitimate high-value participation.
</Info>

## Incentive Imbalance

### Risk

Economic incentives could become misaligned, favoring one user type over another or creating unsustainable reward structures.

### Mitigation Strategies

**Royalty Split Adjustment:**
- Current: 20% creator, 80% prize pool
- Possible: 25% creator, 75% pool (if needed)
- Monitor and adjust based on metrics

**Freestyle Pricing Monitoring:**
- Track pricing trends
- Prevent excessive pricing
- Ensure accessibility

**Regular Review:**
- Monitor platform health metrics
- Adjust mechanisms as needed
- Maintain balance between user types

<Note>
  Adjustments are made transparently based on data, not arbitrarily. User feedback informs changes.
</Note>

## Time Decay Model Issues

### Risk

Linear time decay may discourage late participation or create abrupt value changes.

### Mitigation Strategies

**Exponential Decay Testing:**
- Test exponential decay models (`k=0.1`)
- Smooth value decay
- Increase late collect participation by 15%

**Model Optimization:**
- A/B testing different decay functions
- Monitor user behavior
- Optimize based on engagement data

**Flexibility:**
- Platform can adjust decay models
- Respond to user feedback
- Balance early and late incentives

## Manipulation and Collusion

### Risk

Coordinated manipulation could distort outcomes:
- Vote rigging through coordinated collects
- Pump-and-dump schemes for freestyle JPEGs
- Bot activity or fake accounts

### Mitigation Strategies

**Anomaly Detection:**
- Flag accounts with >50% of collects on single photo
- Detect coordinated collection patterns
- Monitor trading volumes for manipulation

**Account Verification:**
- Prevent bot accounts
- Verify user identity
- Limit account creation

**Transparency:**
- Public collect and trade data
- Community reporting mechanisms
- Clear consequences for manipulation

<Warning>
  Manipulation undermines platform integrity. Violations result in account suspension and potential legal action.
</Warning>

## User Privacy and Data Protection

### Risk

Photo ownership and data usage raise privacy concerns, particularly with GDPR compliance.

### Mitigation Strategies

**GDPR Compliance:**
- Anonymize photo metadata
- Clear user agreements
- Right to deletion
- Data protection standards

**Photo Ownership:**
- Transparent terms of service
- Clear ownership rights
- Compliance with regulations
- User consent for data usage

**Data Security:**
- Secure storage
- Encrypted transmission
- Access controls
- Regular security audits

## Financial Risks

### Risk

Users may lose significant value through poor decisions or market volatility.

### Mitigation Strategies

**Education:**
- Clear documentation
- Risk warnings
- Best practices guides
- Community support

**Limits:**
- Encourage responsible participation
- Limit extreme concentration
- Prevent excessive risk-taking

**Transparency:**
- Clear pricing
- Visible fees
- Predictable mechanics
- No hidden costs

<Info>
  Users should only participate with PX or funds they can afford to lose. The platform provides tools and education, but users make their own decisions.
</Info>

## Platform Sustainability

### Risk

Economic model may become unsustainable if participation declines or costs exceed revenue.

### Mitigation Strategies

**Diversified Revenue:**
- Multiple revenue streams (fees, B2B, data)
- Not reliant on single source
- Sustainable economics

**Deflationary Mechanism:**
- $JPEG buybacks from profits
- Reduces circulating supply
- Increases token value
- Positive feedback loop

**Metrics Monitoring:**
- Track platform health
- Adjust mechanisms proactively
- Maintain sustainable balance

## Regulatory Risks

### Risk

Regulatory changes could impact platform operations or token economics.

### Mitigation Strategies

**Compliance:**
- Follow regulatory guidance
- Legal review of mechanisms
- Adapt to changes

**Transparency:**
- Clear terms of service
- User agreements
- Regulatory communication

**Flexibility:**
- Adapt to regulatory changes
- Maintain platform integrity
- Protect user interests
