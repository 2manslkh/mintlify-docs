## Time Decay Mechanism

The time decay formula governs collect value for themed photos, creating strategic incentives for early participation.

### Formula

```
Shares = f(px, t)
```

Where:
- `px` = Nominal value of a collect (e.g., 20 PX)
- `t` = Normalized time since posting, `t ∈ [0,1]` over 24 hours
- `Shares` = Effective value of the collect in the prediction market

### Linear Decay Model

The standard implementation uses linear decay:

```
f(px, t) = px · (1-t)
```

**Example:**
- At `t=0` (start): `Shares = 20 · (1-0) = 20 shares`
- At `t=0.5` (12 hours): `Shares = 20 · (1-0.5) = 10 shares`
- At `t=1` (24 hours): `Shares = 20 · (1-1) = 0 shares`

<Info>
  This model leverages loss aversion to encourage early collects. Users perceive late collects as a loss compared to maximum shares at t=0.
</Info>

### Exponential Decay Model

An alternative exponential decay model may be implemented:

```
f(px, t) = px · e^(-kt)
```

Where `k` is a decay constant (e.g., `k=0.1`).

**Benefits:**
- Smoother value decay
- May increase late collects by 15% (based on simulations)
- More gradual reduction in share value

**Example with k=0.1:**
- At `t=0`: `Shares = 20 · e^0 = 20 shares`
- At `t=0.5`: `Shares = 20 · e^(-0.05) ≈ 19 shares`
- At `t=1`: `Shares = 20 · e^(-0.1) ≈ 18 shares`

### Freestyle JPEGs

Freestyle JPEGs are **not subject to time decay**. Their value is market-driven based on:
- Scarcity
- Creator reputation
- Community demand
- Trading dynamics

## Prize Pool Distribution

### Expected Prize Pool Formula

The expected prize pool for linear decay is:

```
Prize Pool = 0.8 · N · V · ∫₀¹(1-t)dt = 0.4 · N · V
```

Where:
- `N` = Number of collects
- `V` = Value per collect (20 PX)
- `0.8` = 80% allocated to prize pool
- `0.4` = Result of integration

### Example Calculation

For `N=2,000` collects at `V=20` PX each:

```
Total Collects: 2,000 × 20 = 40,000 PX
Prize Pool: 0.4 × 2,000 × 20 = 16,000 PX (80%)
Creator Royalties: 0.1 × 2,000 × 20 = 4,000 PX (20%)
```

### Exponential Decay Impact

Simulations suggest exponential decay (`k=0.1`) increases the prize pool by **10%** compared to linear decay, as more shares are maintained throughout the collection period.

## Revenue Distribution Table

| Transaction | Creator Revenue | Prize Pool |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 100 themed collects at 20 PX | 400 PX (20%) | 1,600 PX (80%) |
| 50 freestyle JPEGs at 10 PX | 500 PX (direct) | - |

## Monte Carlo Simulations

### Time Decay Model Simulation

A Monte Carlo simulation of the time decay model predicts:
- **40% increase in early collects** when `k=0.1` in exponential decay formula
- More balanced participation throughout 24-hour period
- Improved prize pool distribution

### Freestyle JPEG Trading

Based on NFT market analogies:
- Freestyle JPEG trading projected to increase creator revenue by **25%**
- Market dynamics similar to meme-based cryptocurrency markets
- Scarcity and creator reputation drive value

## Mathematical Properties

### Time Decay Characteristics

**Linear Decay:**
- Constant rate of decay
- Predictable value reduction
- Sharp cutoff at t=1

**Exponential Decay:**
- Gradual value reduction
- Never reaches zero (asymptotic)
- Smoother user experience

### Share Distribution

Shares are distributed proportionally:

```
User Payout = (User Shares / Total Winning Shares) × Prize Pool
```

This ensures fair distribution based on:
- Collection timing (shares)
- Number of collects per user
- Winning photo selection

## Optimization Considerations

### Decay Constant Selection

The decay constant `k` balances:
- Early collect incentives
- Late collect participation
- Prize pool size
- User experience

**Testing:** Beta tests with `k=0.1` showed positive results.

### Prize Pool Efficiency

The 80/20 split optimizes:
- Creator incentives (20% royalties)
- Collector rewards (80% prize pool)
- Platform sustainability
- User retention

<Note>
  Platform may adjust splits (e.g., 25% creator, 75% pool) based on metrics and user feedback.
</Note>

## Validation Metrics

Based on beta testing and simulations:

- **Prize Pool Size:** Matches theoretical calculations
- **Share Distribution:** Proportional and fair
- **User Behavior:** Aligns with model predictions
- **Revenue Projections:** On track with estimates

<Tip>
  Mathematical models guide platform design, but real-world user behavior and community dynamics also shape outcomes. The platform adapts based on data.
