## Overview

JPEG's design leverages key principles from behavioral economics and human psychology to create engaging, economically-sustainable user experiences. Understanding these principles helps explain platform dynamics and user behavior.

## Loss Aversion

### Concept

Loss aversion, a core principle of prospect theory, posits that losses loom larger than equivalent gains in decision-making.

### Application in JPEG

**Time Decay Mechanism:**
The time decay mechanism for themed collects (`Shares = f(px, t)`) creates a sense of urgency:
- Users risk losing share value by delaying collects
- Late collects feel like a loss compared to maximum shares at t=0
- This drives early participation

**Freestyle JPEGs:**
Scarcity (e.g., limited editions) amplifies perceived loss:
- Users fear missing out on limited editions
- Encourages rapid purchases to secure valuable assets
- FOMO (fear of missing out) drives engagement

<Info>
  Loss aversion explains why users collect early despite uncertainty—they want to avoid the "loss" of reduced shares.

## Social Proof

### Concept

Social proof occurs when individuals conform to others' actions under the assumption they reflect correct behavior.

### Application in JPEG

**Visible Metrics:**
- Collect counts for themed photos signal popularity
- Trading volumes for freestyle JPEGs indicate value
- Users follow trends based on visible signals

**Effects:**
- Amplifies engagement (popular photos get more collects)
- Risks herd behavior (users overlook niche content)
- Can reduce diversity in predictions and trades

### Mitigation

Platform design balances social proof with discovery:
- Tag system enables niche content discovery
- Algorithmic curation prevents total herd behavior
- Multiple monetization paths reduce winner-take-all dynamics

## Endowment Effect

### Concept

The endowment effect suggests people ascribe higher value to items they own.

### Application in JPEG

**Earned Assets:**
- Users overvalue earned PX from royalties
- Owned freestyle JPEGs feel more valuable
- Increases willingness to speculate

**A-to-B Transition:**
- Creators reinvest earnings into trading
- Endowment effect strengthens transition from creator to speculator
- Perpetuates platform's economic cycle

## Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic Motivation

### Concept

Self-determination theory distinguishes:
- **Intrinsic motivation:** Driven by internal satisfaction
- **Extrinsic motivation:** Driven by external rewards

### Application in JPEG

**User A (Creators):**
- Intrinsically motivated by creative expression
- Derive joy from social validation
- Financial rewards complement intrinsic motivation

**User B (Speculators):**
- Extrinsically motivated by financial gains
- Focus on collects and trading returns
- Capital accumulation drives engagement

**Motivation Bridge:**
JPEG's royalties and freestyle sales bridge motivations:
- Creators stay engaged for creative reasons
- Financial rewards encourage continued participation
- Enhanced retention across user types

<Tip>
  The dual motivation system ensures both creators and speculators find value in the platform, creating a sustainable ecosystem.

## Framing Effects

### Concept

Framing effects occur when the presentation of information influences decisions.

### Application in JPEG

**Theme Wording:**
- Vague, evocative themes increase submissions by 20%
- "Round" vs "Boy Dinner" shapes submission quality and quantity
- Engaging prompts drive better responses

**Freestyle JPEGs:**
- Framing limited editions as exclusive boosts perceived value
- Cultural significance framing drives sales and trades
- Marketing language influences purchasing decisions

### Best Practices

- Use engaging, subjective prompts
- Frame scarcity positively
- Emphasize community and culture
- Avoid overly prescriptive themes

## Overconfidence Bias

### Concept

Users tend to overestimate their ability to predict outcomes.

### Application in JPEG

**Speculators:**
- Believe they can identify winning photos early
- Overconfidence drives early collects
- Increases engagement and platform activity

**Risk:**
- Can lead to poor decisions
- May concentrate collections unwisely
- Requires platform safeguards

### Mitigation

- Educational content on prediction accuracy
- Diversification recommendations
- Transparent data on success rates

## Anchoring

### Concept

Users rely heavily on the first piece of information encountered.

### Application in JPEG

**Initial Pricing:**
- First freestyle JPEG price sets expectations
- Early collect values anchor user perceptions
- Influences subsequent decisions

**Mitigation:**
- Provide market context
- Show price ranges
- Enable price discovery

## Design Implications

### For Creators

- Clear feedback on collections and royalties
- Social validation through metrics
- Financial rewards complement creative satisfaction

### For Speculators

- Transparent time decay visualization
- Social proof through collect counts
- Framing that emphasizes opportunity

### For Platform

- Balance social proof with discovery
- Prevent winner-take-all dynamics
- Support both user types equally

<Note>
  Behavioral economics principles guide design, but ethical considerations ensure fair, transparent mechanics that benefit all users.
