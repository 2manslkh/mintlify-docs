## Vision

JPEG transforms passive photo-taking into an on-chain economic ecosystem. What makes JPEG unique is its fusion of three powerful concepts:

1. **Daily Ritualistic Game** - Like BeReal, but with economic incentives
2. **Prediction Market** - Capital-backed truth discovery through collects
3. **Tradable Assets** - Freestyle JPEGs as market-driven digital collectibles

## Core Mechanics

### The Social Side: A Global Creative Canvas

Daily themes serve as a catalyst for user-generated content (UGC), prompting participants to capture unique moments—whether artistic snapshots, humorous takes, or poignant life scenes. This mirrors the ritualistic engagement of BeReal, but elevates it by transforming each photo into a cultural artifact with economic potential.

As of October 2025, JPEG has driven an impressive **220,000+ waitlist signups**, reflecting strong market pull and cultural resonance.

### The Prediction Game: Speculation Meets Intuition

The speculative dimension introduces a prediction market where users "collect" photos by betting 20 PX each, anticipating the day's most popular submission. The time decay mechanism rewards early risk-takers with higher shares while penalizing late bets.

**Time Decay Formula:**
```
Shares = px · (1-t)
```
Where:
- `px` = collect value (20 PX)
- `t` = normalized time over 24 hours (0 = start, 1 = end)

This gamified layer, rigorously tested with 100 IRL beta users, has demonstrated a **10-15% engagement uplift** through quests and milestones.

### UGC Engine & Entertainment Value

JPEG stands as a robust UGC engine, converting passive photo-taking into an on-chain economic ecosystem. Brands such as Nike can sponsor themed weeks (e.g., "Just Do It"), leveraging user creativity for viral marketing campaigns that generate authentic content at scale.

  This model draws inspiration from MrBeast's attention-heuristic approach, where entertainment value amplified by high engagement creates cultural and economic momentum.

## True Social Concept

The innovation of JPEG lies in its **"True Social"** concept, inspired by Polymarket's capital-backed prediction model. In Polymarket, financial stakes aggregate collective wisdom, pricing outcomes as probabilities and rewarding accurate predictions.

Similarly, JPEG's capital flows through collects reveal the "truth" of creative resonance: the most compelling photos rise to the top, ensuring fair rewards for contributors. This on-chain mechanism democratizes value creation in the internet's creative space, transforming attention into heuristic worth.

## Token System

JPEG introduces a **dual token system** to balance user engagement and investor speculation:

### Pixels (PX)
- In-game token for themed collects and freestyle purchases
- Designed to feel non-financialized for users
- May operate off-chain for simplicity or on-chain for transparency

### $JPEG
- Governance token for investors
- Enables speculation on platform success
- Serves as on-ramp/off-ramp for financial transactions
- Deflationary mechanism through profit reinvestment

## Platform Statistics

Based on beta testing and market analysis:

- **Waitlist Signups:** 220,000+
- **Beta Engagement Uplift:** 10-15% (with quests and milestones)
- **Referral DAU Increase:** 15% (beta tests)
- **Target Stage 2 DAU:** 1,500-3,000 (based on BeReal metrics)
