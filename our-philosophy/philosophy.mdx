JPEG started from a simple question:

<Note>
**If attention is the currency of the internet, why don't the people who create it get paid in it?**
</Note>

Traditional social media made creation abundant but ownership impossible.

Platforms captured the value of human attention and redistributed it as likes — digital sugar, not capital.

JPEG flips that logic.

It treats creativity, participation, and timing as measurable actions that generate value.

By turning photos into micro-markets, JPEG doesn't just record attention — it *prices* it.
